# Carrington
A mixed hardware/software solution for a mesh network computer/information centre for disaster support.
The project is named after the 1959 Carrinton solar storm that destroyed telegraphs etc and if repeated toady could lead
to the complete meltdown of modern life. 

The intention is to look into developing a small low power computer that can be powered by PV/Battery/hand generator.
The computer will contain information necessary to survival in as many languages as possible.
It will also be able to communicate with othere similar devices using mesh networking via non-licensed citizen band radio
